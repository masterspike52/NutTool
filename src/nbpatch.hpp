// Mod packages in NB Studio's .nbpatch format, which reNut (F:\renut2, renut_engine/mods) loads at
// startup without touching the game folder.
//
// A package is a zip with patch.json and one entry per changed game file:
//   patch.json   {"Format": 1, "Id", "Name", "Version", "Author", "Category", "Description",
//                 "Files": [{"Path", "Kind", "SourceSha256", "SourceSize", "TargetSha256",
//                            "TargetSize", "Entry"}]}
//   "delta"      replaces an existing game file: an NBDL delta against the file's expanded form;
//                SourceSha256/SourceSize are those of the file as it is on disc (before expanding)
//   "new"        adds a file the game folder does not have (the whole file is stored)
// Paths are relative to the game folder with '/' separators ("Bundle/4f/685374"). Hashes are
// lower-case hex SHA-256. The loader checks the original against SourceSha256, rebuilds the file
// and checks it against TargetSha256, so a package only applies to the exact files it was made from.
//
// The expanded form (NB Studio's PatchPackage.Expand): an XCTD file decompressed; a Bundle/50
// streaming archive (magic 0x438CB47C) followed by every XCTD entry inside it, decompressed, in
// entry order (stopping at the first entry that does not decompress); any other file as it is.
//
// NBDL: "NBDL", u32 version 1, u64 target length (little-endian), then ops to the end:
//   0x01 COPY varint source offset, varint length   (from the expanded original)
//   0x02 ADD  varint length, bytes
